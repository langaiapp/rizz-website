# Privacy Policy

Our Commitment to Your Privacy

We are committed to protecting your privacy and the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and disclose information when you use the RIZZ app ("the App").

#### Information We Collect:
When you use RIZZ AI, we may collect the following types of information:
User-Provided Information: We may collect information that you voluntarily provide to us, such as screenshots of conversations and related text data that you upload to the app.
Device Information: We may collect information about your mobile device, including the model, operating system version, and other technical details.
Usage Information: We may collect information about how you use the app, including how frequently you use it and the types of content you access.
Analytics Information: We may use third-party analytics tools to collect information about how users interact with the app. This information may include which features are used most frequently, the length of time spent in the app, and other similar information.

#### How We Use Information:
We may use the information we collect to:
Provide personalized responses for the conversations you upload
Improve the app's performance and user experience
Analyze app usage and user behavior to improve the app and develop new features
Send notifications and updates about the app

#### Sharing of Information:
We may share the information we collect with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as data analysis and technical support. These service providers may have access to your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
We may also share information with law enforcement or other third parties if required by law or if we believe that such disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, the safety of our users, or the public.

#### Security:
We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. We use encryption and secure servers to store and transmit data, and we restrict access to personal information to only those employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our services.
However, no security system is completely foolproof, and we cannot guarantee the security of the information we collect.

#### Children's Privacy:
The app is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will take steps to delete that information as soon as possible.
#### Changes to This Policy:
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you through the app or by other means. Your continued use of the app after we make changes to this policy will constitute your acceptance of those changes.
